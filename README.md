## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list and built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, it uses the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## Demo

The following video shows examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia Core.
